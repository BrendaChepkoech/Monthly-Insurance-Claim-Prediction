# Monthly-Insurance-Claim-Prediction

## Problem statement

Short-term insurance claims are one of the largest costs in the insurance industry, and are extremely difficult to forecast. Zimnat Insurance wants to predict the value of future claims per client, in order to better forecast annual costs

## Objective 

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict how much a client will claim from Zimnat per month for a whole year.

The solution will aid Zimnat in being better prepared to address claims that are submitted, and improve customer satisfaction by alerting clients to possible claims they will make in the future.

Zimnat has been a leading player in the Zimbabwean life assurance and short-term insurance industries since 1946. For over 70 years, Zimnat has been protecting the assets of Zimbabweans, managing their wealth and ensuring that their assets and funds are passed onto future generations, should that be their wish.
